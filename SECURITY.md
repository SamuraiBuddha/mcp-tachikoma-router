# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Contact Information
- **Primary Contact:** Jordan Ehrig - jordan@ehrig.dev
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Secure Communication:** Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting

## Vulnerability Handling

### Severity Levels
- **Critical:** Remote code execution, network compromise, router access breach
- **High:** Privilege escalation, authentication bypass, credential exposure
- **Medium:** Information disclosure, denial of service, configuration exposure
- **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact

### Response Timeline
- **Critical:** 24 hours
- **High:** 72 hours  
- **Medium:** 1 week
- **Low:** 2 weeks

## Security Measures

### Router Management Security
- Secure authentication to router interfaces
- Encrypted communication channels (HTTPS/SSH)
- Network credential protection via environment variables
- Input validation and command sanitization
- Access logging and audit trails
- Network segmentation and firewall controls

### MCP Security
- Environment-based credential injection only
- No network credentials in source code
- Rate limiting on management endpoints
- Command validation and whitelisting
- Session management and timeouts
- Secure error handling

### Network Security
- VPN access for router management
- Strong authentication mechanisms
- Credential rotation schedules
- Network access controls
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Backup configuration encryption

## Incident Response Plan

### Detection
1. **Automated:** Network monitoring alerts, security scanning
2. **Manual:** User reports, configuration audits
3. **Monitoring:** Unusual network traffic patterns

### Response
1. **Assess:** Determine severity and network impact
2. **Contain:** Isolate affected network segments
3. **Investigate:** Network forensics and root cause analysis
4. **Remediate:** Apply patches and configuration fixes
5. **Recover:** Restore normal network operations
6. **Learn:** Post-incident review and improvements

## Security Audits

### Regular Security Reviews
- **Code Review:** Every pull request
- **Network Scan:** Weekly vulnerability assessments
- **Configuration Audit:** Monthly router configuration reviews
- **Penetration Test:** Quarterly network security testing

### Last Security Audit
- **Date:** 2025-07-03 (Initial setup)
- **Scope:** Architecture review and security template deployment
- **Findings:** No issues - initial secure configuration
- **Next Review:** 2025-10-01
